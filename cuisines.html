  <section class="section section-dark">
    <h2>Soupe à l'oignon</h2>
    <p>This is a traditional French soup made of onions and beef stock, usually served with croutons and melted cheese on top. Dating back to Roman times, this was traditionally a peasant dish although the current version dates from the 18th century. The soup’s unique flavor comes from the caramelization of the onions, which often have brandy or sherry added during the slow-cooking process.  </p>

    <h2>Creme Brulee</h2>
    <p> Flecked with espresso and flavored with pure vanilla, this is my favorite crème brûlée recipe. The brilliantly creamy custard can only be reached by cracking through a crisp caramelized sugar ceiling. The textural difference between the two layers is unbelievable and separates this dessert from every other. Simply put, crème brûlée tastes like luxury.</p>

  <section class="section section-dark">
    <h2>Chocolate soufflé</h2>
    <p>The word soufflé comes from the French verb ‘to blow’ and, and the name suggests, this is a light, airy dessert. The dish dates back to the early 18th century and nowadays is a staple on dessert menus around the world. The crispy chocolatey crust is perfect for letting the creamy chocolate ooze out for a rich surprise. However, it doesn’t have to be sweet. In fact, cheese soufflés are just as delicious if you’re looking for something a little saltier. </p>

    <h2>Tarte Tatin</h2>
    <p>According to culinary legend, tarte Tatin started life as a mistake. In 1898, hotelier Stephanie Tatin was making a traditional apple pie when she accidentally left the apples cooking in sugar and butter for too long. In a hurry to rescue the dessert, she put the pastry base on top of the burning fruit and put it in the oven. She supposedly served the upside-down tart to her guests at Hôtel Tatin and the result turned into the hotel’s signature dish. And we can still taste this excellent mistake today.  </p>

  <section class="section section-dark">
    <h2>Flamiche</h2>
    <p>Flamiche means ‘cake’ in Flemish and this dish originates from northern France, near the border with Belgium. It has a puff-pastry crust filled with cheese and vegetables and resembles a quiche. The traditional filling is leeks and cream, although various variations exist. There’s also a pizza-like version of flamiche, which comes without the top crust of the pie. For a southern French twist, try the thin crusty pissaladière, which has anchovies, onions, and olives. </p>

6)  Macaron

  <section class="section section-dark">
    <h2>Macarons</h2>
    <p>French macaroon is a sweet meringue-based confection made. There is some variation in whether the term macaron or macaroon is used. The macaron is traditionally held to have been introduced in France by the Italian chef of queen Catherine De Medici during the Renaissance. Since the 19th century, a typical Parisian-style macaron is presented with a ganache, buttercream or jam filling sandwiched between two such cookies, akin to a sandwich cookie. The confection is characterized by a smooth squared top, a ruffled circumference—referred to as the "crown" or "foot" or "pied"—and a flat base. It is mildly moist and easily melts in the mouth. Macarons can be found in a wide variety of flavours that range from traditional raspberry, chocolate to unusual foie gras, matcha.
